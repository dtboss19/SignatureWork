#  Undergraduate Project Portfolio

A collection of personal projects developed throughout my undergraduate studies at the University of St. Thomas.

---

## Overview

This portfolio showcases four personal projects that demonstrate my skills across various domains including blockchain development, game theory, web scraping, and web development. Each project reflects my passion for combining computer science with real-world applications. You'll find navigation to each repository along with detailed descriptions of what each project accomplishes.

## Projects

###  Project 1 - Crypto Tax Organizer

**The Problem:** Cryptocurrency transactions on blockchains are taxable events, but organizing and tracking them without expensive software (often costing thousands of dollars) is nearly impossible.

**The Solution:** A tool designed to cut down on time-consuming steps like manually reviewing blockchain explorer history.

#### What I Built
- Queries transaction logs directly from the **Solana blockchain**
- Integrates with the [Helius API](https://www.helius.dev/) for transaction data
- Filters transactions by time range using public wallet address keys
- Extracts timestamps and other critical transaction information
- Organizes transactions by **date** and **amount**
- Automatically categorizes transactions by type

#### What I Learned
- Querying blockchain transaction logs
- Working with the Helius API documentation
- Building processes for transaction identification and categorization

#### Connection to Mission
This project embodies the pursuit of **Common Good** at the University of St. Thomas through innovation. It provides a free resource that helps people avoid expensive premium options and simplifies their tax preparation process.

###  Project 2 - Gigaverse Calculator

**The Problem:** [Gigaverse.io](https://gigaverse.io) is a roguelite browser game on the [Abstract Blockchain](https://www.abs.xyz/) that functions as a rock-paper-scissors battler with values assigned to each move. Maximizing rewards requires optimal decision-making.

**The Solution:** An expected value calculator that determines the best move based on the current game state.

#### What I Built
- Captures real-time game state data
- Calculates expected value for each possible move
- Accounts for both player and enemy state changes
- Uses bearer token authentication to pull game data from the server

#### What I Learned
- Making authenticated API calls
- Extracting and utilizing game state data
- Understanding the value of real-time data in decision-making applications

#### Why I Included This
This is a project I actively used while playing the game. It required creative problem-solving to intercept and utilize game data effectively.

###  Project 3 - Game Theory Nash Equilibrium Finder for League of Legends (Draft Phase)

**The Problem:** In competitive League of Legends, the draft phase is a strategic game within itself. Finding optimal champion selections requires analyzing vast amounts of data.

**The Solution:** A Python implementation of game theory principles to find subgame perfect Nash equilibrium strategies for the draft phase.

#### What I Built
- **Web Scraping:** Captures player performance data from third-party sites
- **Champion Analytics:** Analyzes champion winrates against opposing champions
- **Custom Database:** Created flags for each playable champion with pairwise bonuses for complementing team compositions
- **RIOT Games API Integration:** Retrieves match history and player usernames
- **Backwards Induction Algorithm:** Finds potential subgame perfect Nash equilibrium strategy profiles

#### Components of the Model
1. Player performance data (scraped from historical data)
2. Champion vs. champion winrate matchups
3. Team composition synergy bonuses

#### What I Learned
- Building and implementing mathematical models in Python
- Working with the RIOT Games Development API
- Web scraping for data collection
- Applying game theory concepts (Nash equilibrium, backwards induction) programmatically

#### Why I Included This
This project sits at the intersection of my passions: **computer science**, **economics**, **data science**, and **mathematics**. While still a work in progress, it represents one of my most ambitious and personally meaningful projects.

###  Project 4 - Personal Website

**Live Site:** [dtboss19.github.io](https://dtboss19.github.io)

**The Project:** A personal website developed as part of my Web Development course, showcasing information about me, my projects, and my resume.

#### What I Built
- Personal portfolio website
- Project showcases
- Resume/CV section
- Responsive design with HTML & CSS

#### What I Learned
- HTML structure and semantic markup
- CSS styling and layout techniques
- GET and PUT requests
- Differences between static, REST, and dynamic servers
- Full-stack web development fundamentals

#### Why I Included This
This project summarizes who I am and provides a live, real-world example of my web development experience.
